## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Media queries

### What I learned

Media queries are a key part of responsive web design, as they allow you to create different layouts depending on the size of the viewport, but they can also be used to detect other things about the environment your site is running on, for example whether the user is using a touchscreen rather than a mouse. This helps tremendously when trying to design for ot mobile and PC 

```css
@media (min-width: 378px) {
  .container {
    max-width: 350px;
  }
}
```
### Continued development

One of the things that I would like to improve is the responsivness of the websites and how I can make them look as good on a mobile as on a PC.
